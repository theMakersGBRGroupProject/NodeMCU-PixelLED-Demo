# Networking
To collect network control based projects


NodeMCU-WS2801-Webserver
----------
Quite a lot in this project, it will setup its own AP to allow you to connect and set it to a wifi network.
After that it serves a webpage from the root directory that allows you to control the RGB values of a strand.
It uses js to send the values directly from your browser via a websocket to the Arduino to change values of the strand.

Requires you to connect via the serial monitor to get IP address for connection...
